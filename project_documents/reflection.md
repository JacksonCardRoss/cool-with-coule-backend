# [Cool With Coule] Reflection

## Instructions

1. *Create a new folder within this current folder, and name the new folder
   after your team name*
2. *If you prefer keeping this reflection private to your team, you may change
   the permissions on your folder so that only your teammates + unit instructors
   can view the contents*
3. *Create a copy of this reflection template, and put it in your newly created
   folder *

*Please answer at least one question from each section below. Answers here will
likely be inspiration for the “lessons learned” section of your project
presentation at the end of the unit.*

## Design

* How closely did you follow your design document after the review was complete?
  * We were able to adhere to the majority of the aspects of our design document when it came to the functionality pertaining to customers who want to view our online store, search for a product by its name, log in/sign up, add items to their cart, view their cart, checkout, view their order history and update their account/profile. We also implemented the functionality that when a customer signs up with us, they receive a 10% discount on their order! We were unable to implement the functionalities that an administrator would have: view order histories, and manually update the inventory on-hand of a given product.

* Did your implementation need to change based on what you learned once you were
underway?
  * Our implementation changed once we were underway because we realized that there was certain functionality that became out-of-scope given the time constraints and the complexity of the task(s).


## Project

* How did you handle the ambiguity of defining your own project and user
  stories?
  * Because our project is based on real-life everyday scenarios that we are familiar with as users, it was relatively straightforward to define the use cases.  However, we did take into consideration how things could go wrong, and what that should look like.
* What strategies did you use to decide on concrete work to do to
  satisfy your requirements?
  * We identified what our end points would be based on the functionality that we hoped to accomplish.
* How did you deal with getting stuck on a problem? What strategies did you
  employ to get yourself unblocked?
  * When blockers arose, we would consult with the team in our daily stand-up meetings and put our heads together and solve the issue.
* Did any of your commitments you made in your team charter help navigate a
  difficult decision, situation, or collaboration challenge? How?
  * Our team charter helped us to stay on track in terms of responsibilities and expectations.


## Scrum

* What did you find to be the most valuable part of daily stand-ups? 
  * Determining as a group what the goals for the day were.
* Is there anything you would want to do differently at stand-up to make it more useful
  to you?
  * Although it was productive to divide and conquer (especially due to the time constraints) it would have been beneficial to host short tutorials on new learnings that some team members did not have the opportunity to get involved with at a deeper level.
* Did you over or underestimate the work you could complete during your sprints?
  * We overestimated the work that could be completed during a sprint, however we managed to efficiently adjust our scope in order to stay within the means of the sprint’s intent.
* What have you learned that will help you better estimate work next time?
  * To allocate more time to areas that we are not familiarized with.
  * To not add too much to our to-do lists in terms of what is in-scope.


## Looking ahead

* If you were to start this unit over again, what would you do differently? 
  * Allocated more time learning front-end operations and specifically how it interacts with the APIs
  * Allocated more time learning how to write API documentation

* How do you see yourself applying that to your work in later units, the capstone,
  or your internship?
  * Having a more fulsome understanding of front-end operations will enable better communication with front-end engineers
  * The ability to write clear API documentation will be key in communicating to other developers the expected functionality of a program
  * The experience gained through writing unit tests and testing our Lambda functions will be beneficial training for future projects
  * Overall, the experience of implementing a program and its functionality from start to finish has been very beneficial because we are able to learn the processes and how they are linked together to build a fully functional user interface.
