# [SylviaMohos] - [CoolWithCoule] Accomplishment Tracking

Each team member should have their own version of this document.

## Background

It's a great habit to record accomplishments and progress throughout your SDE
career. It's useful to reflect on what you've worked on in the past and comes in
handy during performance reviews and promotion cycles.

## Instructions

**Save a copy of this document in your “private” folder.**

Using the below template, keep track of what you’ve worked on each week during
the unit. 1-3 bullets under each section for each week should suffice. This
should only take 5 - 10 minutes of reflection each week.

As you track your work, think about how it relates to the SDE fundamental skills
laid out in the syllabus and how you are practicing them.

* Converts a design into code and delivers it using best practices
* Writes secure, testable, maintainable code
* Understands when to use (or not) a broad range of data structures and
  algorithms
* Creates unit tests that thoroughly test functionality
* Troubleshoots by debugging and reviewing errors, logfiles, and metrics
* Contributes to planning and design
* Escalates when projects hit roadblocks and risks

The important work samples don’t only include the things you authored, but
should include things like key CRs you reviewed that you are proud of as well!

_You will submit your completed Accomplishment Tracking Document to your
instructors by the end of the unit._

## Week 1

**Goals:**
- To collaborate and develop an idea and a problem statement for a program that enhances a real-world circumstance.
- To determine the goals of the program which are in-scope and realistically attainable given the time constraints, and to determine the goals of the program that are out of scope.
- To develop the use cases four our problem statement.
- To determine the design pattern of our program and create a comprehensive Class Diagram.
- Development of API documentation. 
- To derive the APIs from the use cases by formulating sequence diagrams to maintain a clear understanding of the functionalities to be achieved.
- To determine the number or required DynamoDB tables to organize the data, and decide on the Partition/Sort Keys as well as whether or not to incorporate a GSI.
- To produce draft concepts of the project’s front-end functionality, including images of the vision of the different web pages, buttons, links, and login service.
- Determine and outline the process for Git workflow to reduce potential error to the main branch.
- To complete the overall Design Document for our project which outlines the points above.

**Activity:**
Daily stand up meetings with the team to decide on the completion goal for the day.
**Important Docs, Commits, or Code Reviews**:
- Design Document
- Team Charter
- Miro Whiteboard - planner

**Things learned:**
- Learned how to divide and conquer based on team strengths.
- How to write and deploy API documentation.
- Understand how to lay out a DynamoDB table and when it is necessary (or not) to use a sort key.


## Week 2

**Goals:**
- Development and completion of the predetermined classes and their functionalities.
- Development and completion of unit tests.
- Development and completion of DynamoDB tables and testing for each.
- Development and completion of Lambda functions for each Provider class.

**Activity:**
- Daily stand up meetings and team code review sessions.
- Testing for each Lambda function to ensure expected behavior.
- Troubleshoot and debug as necessary.

**Important Docs, Commits, or Code Reviews**:
- Commit and push updates for Customer classes, including Unit Tests
- Team code review sessions to ensure functionality across the entire project
- Merge to the Feature Branch when tests and behavior function as expected.

**Things learned:**
- The importance of clear communication with the team when it comes to github workflow.
- The importance of considering the possible ways in which the code could break and develop tests for those cases.
- The importance of considering how the user will want to use our program. 
- Utilization of Amazon S3 Buckets.
- Utilization of GSI’s.

## Week 3

**Goals:**
- Implement front-end functionality.
- Implement API Gateway and test.

**Activity:**
- Paired-programming

**Important Docs, Commits, or Code Reviews**:

**Things learned:**
- Basic javascript/jsx implementation using React
- How to properly use the API Gateway and test Lambda functions through curl commands

## Week 4

**Goals:**

- Complete presentation
- Complete documentation

**Activity:**
- Complete anything remaining

**Important Docs, Commits, or Code Reviews**:

**Things learned:**
