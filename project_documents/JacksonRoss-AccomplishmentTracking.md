# [Jackson Ross] - [CoolWithCoule] Accomplishment Tracking

Each team member should have their own version of this document.

## Background

It's a great habit to record accomplishments and progress throughout your SDE
career. It's useful to reflect on what you've worked on in the past and comes in
handy during performance reviews and promotion cycles.

## Instructions

**Save a copy of this document in your “private” folder.**

Using the below template, keep track of what you’ve worked on each week during
the unit. 1-3 bullets under each section for each week should suffice. This
should only take 5 - 10 minutes of reflection each week.

As you track your work, think about how it relates to the SDE fundamental skills
laid out in the syllabus and how you are practicing them.

* Converts a design into code and delivers it using best practices
* Writes secure, testable, maintainable code
* Understands when to use (or not) a broad range of data structures and
  algorithms
* Creates unit tests that thoroughly test functionality
* Troubleshoots by debugging and reviewing errors, logfiles, and metrics
* Contributes to planning and design
* Escalates when projects hit roadblocks and risks

The important work samples don’t only include the things you authored, but
should include things like key CRs you reviewed that you are proud of as well!

_You will submit your completed Accomplishment Tracking Document to your
instructors by the end of the unit._

## Week 1

**Goals:**
- SCRUM meeting with teammates to determine what our products are and what we plan to accomplish
- Determine what our final product will deliver. Such as creating a functional website that sells kitchenware: tea towels, aprons and oven-mittens.

- Determine a design pattern.
- Discuss what our in scope and out of scope functionality were.


**Activity:**
- Standup meetings.
- Creating the design document.


**Important Docs, Commits, or Code Reviews**:
- Design Document.
- Team Charter.
- PlantUML Diagrams


**Things learned:**
- The benefits of planning before writing any code
- The benefits of creating UML diagrams
- Discussing all probable use cases and outcomes with team


## Week 2

**Goals:**
- Finish the backend by the end of the week.
- Create working lambda functions.
- Set up the necessary class for dynamodb.
- Create the necessary api calls.

**Activity:**
- Worked on the necessary pojo class to set up dynamodb.
- Created the necessary lambda functions for each API call.
- Created unit testing for the lambda functions.
- Code review to ensure functions were working as intended and to keep everyone on track.


**Important Docs, Commits, or Code Reviews**:

**Things learned:**
- The importance of daily stand up meetings to bring up problems that have risen.
- Learning how to overcome merge conflicts when working on a group project.
- Having a better understanding of our design. Such as creating different classes for different Requests and Results/Responses.

- Learning what is in/out of scope and changing the scope based on what could actively get done.

## Week 3

**Goals:**
- Finish a GOOD looking frontend.
- Learn React.


**Activity:**
- Paired-programming.

**Important Docs, Commits, or Code Reviews**:

**Things learned:**
