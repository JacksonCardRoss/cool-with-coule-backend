## We ended up using fewer endpoints than we had originally made

**Endpoints out of scope:**

*DeleteCustomerActivity* - No time to implement on front end

*GetOrderActivity* - Not needed/no way to look at previous orders

*GetOrdersActivity* - No time to implement on front end - **Admin Feature**

*DeleteProductActivity* - No time to implement on front end

*GetInventoryOfProducts* - The way GetProductsActivity is set up, you can get the entire inventory by just providing an empty string

*PostProductActivity* - No time to implement on front end - **Admin Feature**

*PutProductActivity* - No time to implement on front end - **Admin Feature**
